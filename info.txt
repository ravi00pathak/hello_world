this is a simple python program that decorates the location given in the entry box

How it works:
1 > first it create 12 blank file related directory.
2 > it fetches all the file on the given location.
3 > it fetches extension of individual file and move to the appropiate directory.
4 > it checks which directory is empty and which not.
5 > it deletes all the empty directory on the given location.
